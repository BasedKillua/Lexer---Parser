## Project Introduction

In your own words, provide a brief overview of this project, highlighting the key components of the project that you will be reviewing in the Discussion section.

## Execution and Development Environment

Java version: XXX
Development Environment: IDE/Codespaces

### Class Diagram

Provide a UML package & class diagram, including details for everything you added or modified. Provide enough information so that a reader would be able to understand the application (for those classes you did not modify, you may omit the details of the class, but should still include it in the class diagram, with relationships to other classes indicated). Ensure that your diagram is legible at standard screen resolutions, and does not require scrolling - break your diagram up into multiple parts if necessary.

## Scope of work and Project Discussion

Include a list of the tasks and requirements you completed, with a discussion of each task.
